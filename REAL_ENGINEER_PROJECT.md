## Language-Agnostic Testing Strategy

### 🧪 Testing Framework

To ensure implementations work correctly regardless of programming language, all tests use standardized interfaces:

#### 1. File-Based I/O Testing

- **Input**: Standardized binary files with test data

- **Example**: `test_data/btree_insert.bin` → `expected_results/btree_insert.json`

#### 2. Network Protocol Testing

- **Method**: TCP socket communication using binary protocol
- **Test Suite**: Automated scripts that send protocol messages and verify responses
- **Language Support**: Test runners available for multiple languages
- **Example**: Connect, execute query, verify result format and content

#### 3. SQL Compliance Testing

- **Standard**: Subset of SQL-92 specification
- **Test Cases**: Comprehensive SQL queries with expected results
- **Format**: `.sql` files with corresponding `.result` files
- **Validation**: Query result comparison with tolerance for floating-point precision

#### 4. Performance Benchmarking

- **Datasets**: Standardized test datasets of various sizes (1K, 10K, 100K, 1M records)
- **Metrics**: Query execution time, memory usage, disk I/O
- **Reporting**: JSON-formatted performance reports for automated analysis
- **Baseline**: Reference implementation benchmarks for comparison

### 🎯 Test Execution

```bash
# Phase-specific testing
./test_runner.sh --phase 1 --implementation ./my_database
./test_runner.sh --phase 2 --implementation ./my_database
./test_runner.sh --all --implementation ./my_database

# Performance benchmarking

```

### 📊 Test Reporting
